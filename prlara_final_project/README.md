The ATM program, which is a simple yet effective interface that mimics the functionalities of a real bank ATM. The ATM program allows you to perform regular transactions such as adding or withdrawing money from your existing account.

To ensure a high level of security and privacy, the program requires you to provide personal information including your name, last name, age, email, initial balance, username, and password. Once you have successfully logged in, you will be able to add, withdraw, and check your balances.

The program has been designed with a logical file structure to ensure ease of use and reliability. The main.py file contains the logic to create and store new and existing accounts using sqlite3. The user.py file contains the User class which has been created to create and validate new accounts and utilizes the uuid module to generate unique account numbers. The bank.py file contains the User's parent class Bank, which includes general bank attributes and methods. Additionally, a text file containing existing users is fetched every time the program starts.

It is important to note that my program does not require any external libraries and can be easily installed and run on any computer with Python3 installed.

I hope that you find my program useful and user-friendly!

sincerely,

Pedro.
